            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <h2>Please fill out the quick form and we will be in touch with lightning speed.
            Website.com began in 2005. After years in the web hosting industry, we realized that 
            it was near impossible for the average Jane or Joe to create their own website. Traditional
            web hosting services were simply too complicated, time consuming, and expensive to manage.

            We created the Website.com Site Builder with the user's perspective in mind. 
            We wanted to offer a platform that would require no coding skills or design 
            experience. We keep it simple, so users can focus on creating an amazing website
            that reflects their brand. Best of all - it's free. You can get online, showcase 
            your brand, or start selling products right away.

            After seeing an increased need for ecommerce solutions, we developed one of the 
            only fully-featured, free and commission-free online store builders, allowing business 
            owners to launch their online business.

            Today, we're proud to empower individuals and small business owners around the world. 
            Everyone deserves a website, and we're excited to see what you create.</h2>
